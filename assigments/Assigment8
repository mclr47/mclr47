         Software Requirement Specifications 
         For GitHub Statistics 
   
  1.1 Introduction 
  Version control system as git on local machines and GitHub on the web  are important tools for developing software  while tracking the building , deleting , branching of the code and the auxiliary files .
Also the sequential or concurrent contribution inputs from multiple developers represents an extended flexibility.
   1.2  Purpose 
   This document  will touch on Software Requirements Specifications(SRS) from both external aspects and internal  working system.  Also the pallet of non-functional attributes that participates in the completeness of an on stage usable application  is described .   
    1.3 Assumptions and Dependencies
 From the very inception of the project a embryo website was created  with a   contributor box  where all ideas  from the user, system  administrator  , developer etc . were collected and considered . 
  The accessibility of this application is  meant to be compatible across  the proteinoid diversity of Operating System(Windows, Android , MacOS etc)   and electronic devices available (Desktop, Laptops, Mobiles, Projectors).
          This project is designed to be open-ended for customization , administration by the clients and modulated for ease further development.


2 Software Product   Overview


     2.1. Description of The Problem
     
     GitHub as a software developmental platform offeres a colaborative environment over the Internet. The data and metadata associated 
     with individual repositories as well as the activities over these repositories is somehow raw by design .Thus the oportunity of integrating and manipulating this data remains open for variuos kind of analysis including statistical analysis futher wraped by 
     adapting application programming interface (API).
     
      2.2  Technologies Used
      
     $ As a start Internet connection is required and accessed via Server, Desktop, Laptop of Mobile Device .This implies trasposability ,  compatibility 
   and testing    of the software across various environments. 
     $ Browsers endowed with developers' tool for accessing the elements and their attributes, group, collect and process them
     $ coherent GitHub  data/actions  desired as  end poit results, processing goals in terms of language/software handler of the task.

   3. Requirements Traceability 
        of...Inputs:commits , branches, pulls request 
           ..Menus 
           ..Query Editing - provides a logical formula for querry execution
           ..Task Editing ->the dynamic modificatios of the querry
           ..Profiles of GitHub actioneers
           ..Importing /Exporting/Validating information
           ..Session a cut through a specific aspect GitHub or and software interacting with it
           ..Execution and Results obtained from GitHub querries or other actions.

   4. The implementation is aiming to make use of  the following tools : HTML,CSS, JavaScript, JQuery , Canvas , MSSQL, PHP/Ajax.
       Sketch: the proram uses a form to ask the user to fill in predifined parameters that are manipulated by JavaScript/Jquery, styled by CSS, sent over to the 
       server and back to the users by PHP or Ajax,where SQL operates on data under the hood. 
           The display of the data is facilitated by Canvas. 
           
    5. Software deployment  is realized under the standards for user and administrator respectively with the updates taking 
    place periodically as the systems used are changing or upgrading.
    6. The Software is patent pending and any conflicts need to be address to the desiner and the terms of use.
