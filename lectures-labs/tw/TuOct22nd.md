-Team structure:
      1)hyerarchical structure with leadership .
        decicions for the group are weight proportionally with the higher hyerarchical position
        This type of organization is typicl for large groups
      2)for smaller groups /companies  we may have sort of equal participation but division of labor based on skills and preferences.
      3)also for the smaller organization where people know well each other they can have a skill proportional desion and management of the group
